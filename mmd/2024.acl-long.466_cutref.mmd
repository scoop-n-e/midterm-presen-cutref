\begin{abstract}
Neural Theory-of-Mind ( \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{ToM}\) ), machine's ability to understand and keep track of the mental states of others, is pivotal in developing socially intelligent agents. However, prevalent \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{ToM}\) benchmarks have several shortcomings, including the presence of ambiguous and artificial narratives, absence of personality traits and preferences, a lack of questions addressing characters' psychological mental states, and limited diversity in the questions posed. In response to these issues, we construct OpenToM, a new benchmark for assessing N-ToM with (1) longer and clearer narrative stories, (2) characters with explicit personality traits, (3) actions that are triggered by character intentions, and (4) questions designed to challenge LLMs' capabilities of modeling characters' mental states of both the physical and psychological world. Using OpenToM, we reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs thrive at modeling certain aspects of mental states in the physical world but fall short when tracking characters' mental states in the psychological world. \({ }^{1}\)

\section*{1 Introduction}

Theory-of-Mind (ToM), the awareness that others perceive the world differently and the capability of keeping track of such differences, is at the core of social interactions (Premack and Woodruff, 1978). Studies in cognitive science have designed numerous false-belief tests to investigate human ToM capabilities (Premack and Woodruff, 1978; Wimmer and Perner, 1983; Onishi and Baillargeon, 2005). One such test is the Sally-Anne Test (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985), in which Anne stealthily moves an object that is initially known to both Sally and Anne. This covert action causes Sally to have a false belief that the object is still in its initial location. Consequently, individuals taking the test are required to reason about "Where will Sally look for the object?"

Amy is a considerate person. She wants to keep the rubber duck away from Sam. She moves the rubber duck to her own backpack. Unknown to Amy, Sam witnessed her action.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

Figure 1: Illustration of a simplified story from Open\(T O M\) and the corresponding first-order ToM questions. This story features two protagonists: Sam (observer) and Amy (mover); and an entity-of-interest: rubber duck. There are two containers involved: a basket and Amy's backpack. Each narrative within OpenToM is followed by three types of questions, namely questions regarding the location (Loc) of an entity, questions that involve multi-hop reasoning (MHop), and questions about the characters' attitude (Att).

To study Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM) \({ }^{2}\), machines' capabilities of performing ToM reasoning, researchers have applied human ToM tests such as the Sally-Anne Test to benchmark Large Language Models (LLMs) (Le et al., 2019; Bubeck et al.,

\footnotetext{
\({ }^{2}\) In this paper, we distinguish Theory-of-Mind studies between human (ToM) and artificial neural networks (N-ToM).
}

2023; Kosinski, 2023; Shapira et al., 2023a; Ullman, 2023; Wu et al., 2023b; Zhou et al., 2023a). However, using human ToM tests for evaluating LLMs is problematic because stories in human ToM tests lack certain elements found in real-life scenarios. Specifically, the characters do not have personality traits or preferences. Additionally, their actions are not motivated (e.g. why would Anne want to move the object?). Furthermore, the narratives of many existing N-ToM benchmarks are generated using a template-based approach (Le et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2023b; Zhou et al., 2023a), which results in overly-structured and ambiguous narratives (see Appendix A.1). The structured context makes existing benchmarks susceptible to overfitting, while the ambiguities may lead to an underestimation of a model's true N-ToM capabilities.

To this end, we introduce Openbook-QA dataset for ToM (OpenToM). Following previous works' success in generating high-quality data using LLMs (Efrat and Levy, 2020; Perez et al., 2022a,b; Hartvigsen et al., 2022; West et al., 2023), we generate OpenToM stories using a four-stage human-in-the-loop generation pipeline (§2.1). Our pipeline includes (1) endowing characters with preferences and personality traits, (2) generating intentions and the corresponding enctions (Riva et al., 2011), (3) constructing story plot and producing narratives using LLMs, and (4) revise and refine stories by human annotators. Based on the OpenToM narratives, we formulate questions that cover characters' mental states of both the physical world (e.g., the location of an object) and their psychological states (e.g. character's attitude towards a particular action). See Figure 1 for examples.

We evaluate OpenToM dataset on a range of LLMs including Llama2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct (Jiang et al., 2024), GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI, 2022), and GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) under a zero-shot setting. We also test two prompting techniques, namely Chain-ofThought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and SimulatedToM (SimToM) (Wilf et al., 2023). Additionally, we fine-tuned a Llama2-Chat-13B model to serve as the fine-tuning baseline. Our results show that, while fine-tuning and advanced prompting techniques improve models' N-ToM reasoning capabilities, their performance in deducing the psychological states of characters is still far from human performance (Section 3.3). We summarize our contributions as follows:
1. We construct OpenToM, a N-ToM benchmark with natural narratives, personified characters, motivated actions, and diversified questions that challenge LLMs' understanding of characters' perception of both the physical world and the psychological states.
2. Using OpenToM, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on representative LLMs. Our result shows a mismatch of LLMs' capability in deducing characters' mental states of the physical versus the psychological world.
3. Our in-depth analysis reveals LLMs' shortcomings in N-ToM including unfaithfulness in NToM reasoning, sensitivity to narrative length and character roles, and lack of understanding of characters' psychological perception.

\section*{2 The OpenToM Dataset}

The omissions of characters' personality, intention, and enaction in existing N-ToM benchmarks makes it difficult to construct questions that inquire characters' mental states of the psychological world. To address this, each of the characters in OpenTOM stories is personified and acts with an intention (AppendixA.2). Recognizing that LLMs are good at utilizing spurious correlations such as lexical overlaps (Shapira et al., 2023a), we take extra effort in mitigating the potential spurious cues in OpenToM stories (§2.5).

\subsection*{2.1 OpenToM Construction}

A typical OpenToM story consists of two protagonists, an entity-of-interest (referred to as the "entity" henceforth), and several locations and containers. Of the two protagonists, one is assumed as the role of the mover, who carries out actions on the entity, and another is the observer, who may or may not witness these actions (see Figure 1).

As shown in Figure 2, the data generating process consists of two main stages, namely the Character Personification Process followed by the Narrative and Question Generation Process. We start the anthropomorphism process by assigning a personality trait and personal preference to each character. Specifically, the personality traits are sampled from three candidates (see Appendix A.2, and Algorithm 1) and the preference is randomly chosen from binary options. To mitigate spurious correlation, we create false beliefs on characters' perception of each other's personal preferences by

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_b8f9c5ac122675df6b79g-03.jpg?height=604&width=1543&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=256}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 2: The data generating process of OpenToM dataset. Using the story in Figure 1 as an example, the features created in the personification process are shown in Part (A), which include character preference ( \(\boldsymbol{\vee}\) ), belief of the other character's preference ( \(\boldsymbol{0}\) ), the perturbed mover's preference belief ( \(\boldsymbol{\mathbf { a }}\) ), the mover's personality trait ( \(\boldsymbol{\star}\) ), and the mover's intention and action ( \(\mathbf{1}\) ). The usage of these information in the OpenToM plot are shown in Part (B) next to the paragraph indicator. See Appendix A. 3 for detailed description of the Human Annotation and Rule-Based Label Generation process.}
\end{figure}
randomly flipping the preference label (see Section 2.5). Using the sampled personal preferences, personality traits, and a world state initialized from ToMi (Le et al., 2019), we prompt GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate the mover's intention and enactions. The enaction results in world state changes, which are used to construct the final world state. We use this information to draft a story plot, refer to as the OpenToM plot.

A OpenToM plot consists of three paragraphs. The first paragraph illustrate the characters' personal preferences and their beliefs about each other's preferences. The second paragraph serves as the prologue, which depicts the initial world state and some preceding events involving the two characters. The last paragraph describes the main event, which includes the mover's personality, the mover's intention, and their subsequent action. It is worth noting that, in order to reduce ambiguity, we explicitly include information regarding whether the observer perceived the mover's action. We carefully designed the plot as well as the narrative generating process so that the observer's mental activity is excluded from the final OpenToM narrative while ensuring that the observer's perception of the main event is mentioned.

After generating the OpenToM narratives, we classify the corresponding ToM questions into two categories, those requiring human annotation and those that can be automatically annotated using human-defined labels combined with first-order
logic (see Appendix A.3). In the final stage of data generation, we conduct a round of quality inspection. Specifically, we examine each narrative to ensure that (1) the answers to the ToM questions are not directly given in the narrative, (2) The narrative content aligns with commonsense knowledge, and (3) there is no significant lexical overlaps between the narrative and the corresponding ToM questions (as discussed in Section 2.5).

\subsection*{2.2 OpenToM Overview}

Overall, OpenToM contains 696 narratives. We first produce 596 narratives with GPT-3.5-Turbo \({ }^{3}\) using the pipeline shown in Figure 2. In addition, we sample 100 existing OpenToM plots and produce extra-long narratives (OpenToM-L) using GPT-4-Turbo \({ }^{4}\). To elicit the unique N-ToM challenges posted by our OpenToM benchmark, we compare OpenToM with established N-ToM benchmarks in Table 1. See Appendix C for detailed statistics of the OpenToM benchmark.

\subsection*{2.3 Task Formulation}

We formulate all OpenToM questions as binary or ternary classification tasks (see Figure A3 for

detailed label space and label distributions). Formally, given a complete narrative \(\mathcal{N}_{\text {comp }}\), a set of answers \(\mathcal{A}\), a character \(c\), and a character-centric question \(q_{c}\). A model is to first deduce the information accessible to character \(c\), denoted as \(\mathcal{N}_{c}\), and then answer the question. The process of extracting a character-centric narrative \(\mathcal{N}_{c}\) can be made explicit, as in Wilf et al. (2023), or latent, as is common in most ToM evaluations. In general, the OpenToM task can be formulated as follows:
\[
a_{c}^{*}=\operatorname{argmax}_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \mathbb{P}\left(a \mid \mathbb{1}_{\text {expl }} \cdot \mathcal{N}_{c}, \mathcal{N}_{\text {comp }}, q_{c}\right)
\]
where \(\mathbb{1}_{\text {expl }}\) is an indicator function that returns 1 if the character-centric narrative is explicitly provided and 0 otherwise.

\subsection*{2.4 Question Genres}

Each of OpenToM stories is accompanied by 23 questions that cover both first-order ToM and second-order ToM. First-order ToM questions, which directly ask about a character's perception of the world, is illustrated in the bottom of Figure 1. Second-order ToM questions inquire about a character's belief of another character's mental state. For instance, a second-order ToM question based on the story in Figure 1 could be "From Sam's perspective, does Amy think the rubber duck is in its initial location?". Overall, OpenToM questions can be summarized into the following 3 genres:

Location (Loc) questions are concerned with the characters' perception of the entity's location. In

OpenToM, we create two versions of location questions, \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) and \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {fine }} . \mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) asks about the character's perception of whether an entity is at its initial location, while Loc \(_{\text {fine }}\) inquires about the entity's explicit location (see Figure 1 for an example). By doing so, we wish to mitigate the impact of location granularity (Appendix C) and assess the model's faithfulness in answering this type of questions ( \(\S 4.1\) and Appendix C).

Multi-Hop (MHop) questions are composed by adding an additional reasoning hop on top of the Loc questions. Specifically, we inquire about changes in the fullness of the containers and the accessibility of the entity (see Figure 1 for an example), all of which demand 3-hop reasoning (illustrated in Appendix B).

To address the lack of social commonsense in previous N-ToM benchmarks (Ma et al., 2023b), we have devised the accessibility questions specifically for testing LLMs' understanding of social norms. Taking the MHop question in Figure 1 as an example, in attempting to answer this question, a model needs to first reason whether the character knows about the rubber duck's movement. The need for social commonsense comes in the next reasoning hop. Assuming the model is aware that the rubber duck is in Amy's backpack, it must grasp the social commonsense that others shall not take things from Amy's backpack without permission. Therefore, a model with adequate social intelligence shall respond with "less accessible"

Attitude (Att) questions are designed to challenge LLMs' capability to interpret a character's psychological mental state. Specifically, LLMs are required to deduce the observer's potential attitude towards the mover's action (see Figure 1 for an example). As discussed in §2.5, the crux of solving attitude questions is to first identify the information accessible to the observer and then use social commonsense to infer the attitude. In OpenToM, of all the knowledge related to the observer's attitude, only the observer's own preference towards the entity and the mover's action are accessible to the observer (see Figure 3). Therefore, OpenTOM stories are carefully crafted so that LLMs may not succeed by leveraging information inaccessible to the observer (§2.5).

Human's attitude is subjective and multifaceted (Zhan et al., 2023), we reduce such complexity by maximizing the contrast between the observer's
preference and the mover's action. In the story of Figure 1, Amy moves Sam's favorite rubber duck into her own backpack. The substantial disparity between Sam's fondness of the rubber duck and Amy's seemingly selfish act will likely cause Sam to have a negative attitude towards Amy's action. Our data validation study (§2.6) shows the effectiveness of this approach.

\subsection*{2.5 Mitigating Spurious Correlation}

We take measures to mitigate spurious correlation in all questions. Fixing the Loc and MHop questions can be done by revising narratives based on keywords. We identify OpenToM narratives that contain phrases which have substantial lexical overlap with the questions or those that provide shortcuts for answering them (Appendix A.4). We manually revise such narratives to reduce the reporting bias, resulting in revisions for \(17.8 \%\) of the Open\(T O M\) narrative drafts.

To elicit the potential spurious cues in Attitude questions, we define the enaction process as a Bayesian network (Riva et al., 2011; Baker et al., 2011) (Figure 3). Firstly, the intention of the mover (Int) originates from their preference ( \(P_{\text {mov }}\) ), their personality trait ( \(T\) ), and, optionally, the observer's preference ( \(P_{\text {obs }}\) ). This process is latent for the \(o b\) server - the only observable variables are their own preference ( \(P_{\text {obs }}\) ) and the action (Act). Employing the \(d o\)-calculus notation from Pearl (1995), solving the attitude question is equivalent to solving the following problem
\[
a t t^{*}=\operatorname{argmax}_{a t t \in A t t_{o b s}} \mathbb{P}\left(a t t \mid d o(a c t), P_{o b s}\right)
\]
where att is an instantiation of the observer's potential attitudes, \(A t t_{\text {obs }}\). Overall, we identify two types of potential spurious cues, (1) model \(\mathbb{P}(\) att \(\mid\) Int \()\) or (2) model \(\mathbb{P}(\) att \(\mid T)\), as shown in Figure 3. We show that addressing these two spurious correlations concurrently can be achieved by adjusting the mover's beliefs regarding the observer's preference (see Appendix A. 5 for details).

\subsection*{2.6 Dataset Validation}

To verify the human performance and agreement on the OpenToM dataset, we sampled 100 narratives, each of which contains 5 sampled questions covering all 3 question genres asked for both first-order and second-order ToM (see Figure A4 for a demonstration of the data annotation interface). This set of OpenToM data are annotated

independently by 3 annotators. The inter-annotator agreement is reflected through the macro-averaged F1 score (Table 2), which is computed as the arithmetic mean of the pairwise agreement scores (see Appendix C for detailed statistics). The agreement scores demonstrate that the OpenToM questions contain minimal subjectivity and align well with the collective judgement of human annotators.

\section*{3 Experiments}

Following the convention of previous N-ToM studies, we focus on evaluating zero-shot performance of LLMs (Shapira et al., 2023a; Kim et al., 2023b; Sclar et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a).

\subsection*{3.1 Baseline Models}

We evaluate the OpenToM tasks using 6 representative LLMs, namely the Llama2-Chat models (7B, 13B, and 70B) (Touvron et al., 2023), the Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct model (Jiang et al., 2024), and the GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo \({ }^{5}\) models (OpenAI, 2022, 2023). We also fine-tuned a Llama2-Chat 13B model (Appendix D.3). See Appendix D. 1 for detailed description of the models.

\subsection*{3.2 Prompting Techniques}

In addition to the vanilla prompting, we experiment with two additional prompting techniques, namely Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and SimulatedToM (SimTom) (Wilf et al., 2023). CoT prompting is widely used in reasoning tasks. It demands LLMs to explicitly generate its step-by-step

\subsection*{3.3 Overall Results}

As all the OpenToM questions are formulated as binary or ternary classification tasks and considering that the labels are not uniformly distributed (Figure A3), we evaluate model performance using the macro-averaged F1 scores (referred to as F1 scores henceforth).

To evaluate the consistency of LLMs' performance, we randomly sample 50 narratives for each round of evaluation and repeat this process for 5 times for each model. We compute the mean and the standard deviation of the F1 scores, which are reported in Table 2 (See Table A8 for more detailed results. See Table A7 for the breakdown of LLMs' performances on MHop questions). Overall, we see that GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models on Loc coarse (first-order), MHop, and Att questions by a large margin. However, we are surprised to see that Llama2-Chat-7B performs the best in answering second-order Loc \({ }_{\text {coarse }}\). However, due to the high unfaithful rate shown in later studies (§4.1 and Table A9), achieving the highest score does not necessarily imply that Llama2-Chat-7B is more capable in N-ToM. In addition, it is interesting to see that, while GPT-4-Turbo leads in most question genres by a large margin, its capability of answering the \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {fine }}\) questions is not on par with Llama2-Chat-13B, 70B, or GPT-3.5-Turbo.

Through the fine-tuning model, it becomes evident that the \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) and MHop questions are easier to learn, as their F1 scores improved dramatically. On the other hand, the \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {fine }}\) and Att questions pose greater challenges as the F1 score of the
fine-tuned model only have limited improvement.
CoT prompting brings significant performance gains to all models on \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) and MHop questions. However, the improvements in answering Att questions are marginal and the performance on Loc \(_{\text {fine }}\) questions declines. In the case of SimToM prompting, the results for the Mixtral model are mixed. SimToM improves the f1 score of MHop questions, but its performance on other question types is either degraded or negligible. For GPT models, SimToM consistently brings performance gains in \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) questions. However, for other question genres, the effect of SimToM is mixed.

In terms of the length of the narrative, results on OpenToM-L show that ToM in longer narratives are generally harder to trace. Please see Appendix D. 5 for detailed results and analysis.

\section*{4 Detailed Result Analysis}

To further investigate LLMs' N-ToM capabilities, we conduct in-depth analysis on LLMs' faithfulness in answering \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) and \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {fine }}\) questions (§4.1), performance discrepancy of modeling the mental states of different character roles (§4.2), and lack of capability in modeling characters' mental state of the psychological world (§4.3).

\subsection*{4.1 Faithfulness in Loc Questions}

As mentioned in §2.4, we create two types of Loc questions differ in granularity. In principle, Loc \(_{\text {coarse }}\) serves as a prerequisite for answering \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {fine }}\) questions. For instance, if a person believes that the entity is not in its initial location (i.e. \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) ), then they should maintain this belief when deducing its precise location (i.e. Loc \(_{\text {fine }}\) ). We conduct two experiments to examine LLMs'

faithfulness \({ }^{6}\) in answering the Loc questions. In the Joint approach, we present LLMs with Loc \({ }_{\text {coarse }}\) which is immediately followed by Loc \(_{\text {fine }}\) in the same session. In the Separate approach, we prompt LLMs with each Loc question individually.

We consider a model to be Unfaithful if it gives contradictory answers in the ( \(\mathrm{Loc}_{\text {fine }}, \mathrm{Loc}_{\text {coarse }}\) ) pair of questions. To quantify this, we compute the Unfaithful Rate for each model, which is the ratio of unfaithful pairs to the total number of pairs, as shown in Figure 4.

We see that each model's unfaithful rate is lower when answering first-order ToM questions. This is likely due to their relative simplicity comparing to the second-order questions. Further, we see that, for the GPT models, the Joint approach yields lower Unfaithful Rate than the Separate approach. This improvement may attribute to having access to the previous answer in the context. For Mixtral model, however, the same trend is only observed for the first-order questions. As delving into the reason behind this trend is beyond the scope of this paper, we leave it as future work. Detailed evaluation results are shown in Appendix D.6.

\subsection*{4.2 Performance Gap in Character Roles}

Previous works discovered that LLMs are more capable of answering questions related to the protagonist (Sap et al., 2022; Shapira et al., 2023a), which is likely due to them receiving more descriptions regarding their mental states (Grosz et al., 1995). In OpenToM, we consciously avoid such a reporting bias (§2.5). However, apart from the bias towards the protagonists, we observe that there exists another performance discrepancy in modeling the mind of characters of different roles. In OpenToM, the roles are mover and observer.

To demonstrate the performance gap between the mover's and the observer's perception, we compute difference in F1 scores between the models' performance on mover-centric questions and ob-server-centric questions (Table 4).

For second-order Loc questions, the majority of LLMs perform worse when modeling the mover's mental state. This is likely due to the long distance between the description of the mover's action and whether the observer witnessed the action (see an examples in Appendix E). Such distant information make it difficult for LLMs to establish a connection. Hence, deducing the mover's perception of the observer's mental state becomes more challenging.

For MHop questions, all LLMs perform better when modeling the mover's mental states. When answering first-order Mhop questions, models' burden for deciding whether the mover observed their own action is alleviated. In the case of second-order MHop questions, the performance discrepancy is likely due to the explicit mention of the mover's intention. These intentions often involve the mover's perception of the consequences of their actions on the observer, which greatly reduces the complexity of modeling the mover's perception of the observer's mental state.

\subsection*{4.3 Social Commonsense and Attitude}

GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models on MHop questions by a large margin (Table 2, 3, and A7), demonstrating its capability in reasoning using social commonsense. However, other LLMs' performance on MHop questions show that they are lacking in this regard.

As all LLMs performed poorly on Att questions, we additionally tested Self-Ask prompt (Appendix D.2), which asks LLMs to deduce the final answer by explicit proposing and answering series of follow-up questions (Press et al., 2023). While Self-Ask prompting improves the F1 score of LLMs (Table A10), it is still far from human performance, demonstrating LLMs' lack of N-ToM capabilities in perceiving characters' psychological states. By in-depth analysis on the Att answers from Mixtral, and the GPT models, we find two modes or error: low recall in (1) identifying neutral attitude and (2) identifying positive attitude.

Both of the aforementioned error modes can be attributed to LLMs' erroneous correlation between the mover's personality trait and the observer's attitude. In Table 5, we compute the proportion of error cases that are correlated to character's personality. Specifically, we regard the error and the personality as correlated if a mistaken prediction matches the character's personality. For instance, across all prompting methods, more than 95\% of the movers in narratives where GPT-4-Turbo mistakenly identify a positive attitude to be negative have an inconsiderate or negativistic personality (bottom right column in Table 5).

As discussed in §2.5, a considerate mover in OpenToM story does not necessarily take actions that are benign to the observer. Therefore, LLMs are doomed to fail when using such a spurious correlation. See Appendix D. 7 for detailed results.

2023; Kosinski, 2023). This claim was later rebutted by Shapira et al. (2023a) and Ullman (2023), who both demonstrated that LLMs lack robust NToM capabilities. To tackle N-ToM, a line of work used partially observable Markov decision process (Nguyen et al., 2023). Others proposed prompting techniques (Wilf et al., 2023) or neuro-symbolic approaches (Ying et al., 2023; Sclar et al., 2023). We direct readers to Ma et al. (2023b) for a comprehensive survey on N-ToM.
ToM Benchmarks Based on the Sally-Anne Test (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) and bAbi (Weston et al., 2016), Grant et al. (2017) constructed the ToMbAbi dataset for false belief, which was later improved by Le et al. (2019) into the ToMi dataset. Based on ToMi, researchers proposed T4D (Zhou et al., 2023a), which targets N-ToM for assistant agent, and Hi-ToM (Wu et al., 2023b), which focuses on higher-order N-ToM. Other human ToM tests such as the Smarties Test (Gopnik and Astington, 1988), and the Faux Pas Test (Baron-Cohen et al., 1999) were also used for studying N-ToM, leading to datasets such as ToMChallenges (Ma et al., 2023a), BigToM (Gandhi et al., 2023), AdvCSFB (Shapira et al., 2023a), and FauxPas-EAI (Shapira et al., 2023b). However, existing N-ToM benchmarks are either limited in size, contain artificial narratives, or lack diversity in their questions posed. Jones et al. (2023) constructed EPITOME, which contains human ToM tests that go beyond
false-belief. Researchers also put efforts in evaluating LLMs' N-ToM capabilities in dialogues, which resulted in benchmarks such as G-DRAGON (Zhou et al., 2023b), FANToM (Kim et al., 2023c), and SOTOPIA (Zhou et al., 2023c).
ToM and Social Commonsense Sap et al. (2022) showed that LLMs' lack of understanding of social norms using SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019). The FauxPas-EAI dataset (Shapira et al., 2023b) was dedicated to evaluating LLMs' understanding of social commonsense. Efforts were also made to construct knowledge graphs for social commonsense and N-ToM (Wu et al., 2023a).

\section*{6 Future Directions}

Faithfulness Our study of LLMs' performance on Loc \(_{\text {coarse }}\) and Loc fine reveals that all LLMs lack faithfulness when answering N-ToM questions. We recognize that improving LLMs' faithfulness is a challenging task in numerous domains (Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020). Here we propose potential remedies specifically targeting N-ToM tasks. Following the findings in §4.1, neuro-symbolic systems can be potentially deployed to enforce faithfulness in reasoning about the characters' mental state of the physical world. Gao et al. (2023) proposes PAL, which represent reasoning problems with programming language and obtain a deterministic solution using code interpreter. Lyu et al. (2023) combined PAL with CoT and achieved accurate and more faithful reasoning chains.
Performance Gap Between Roles In OpenTOM narrative, we propose two roles, namely a mover and an obsever. Our study in §4.2 unveils LLMs' performance discrepancies in N-ToM between the character roles and analyzes the underlying reasons. In reality, a narrative contain roles well beyond two. To account for the difference in the ToM reasoning process of different roles, a role-aware reasoning framework is needed. Specifically, given an event and a group of characters, the framework needs to first identify the role that each character plays in the event and then conduct ToM reasoning accordingly.

\section*{Social Commonsense and Psychological N-ToM}

Analysis in §4.3 shows that most LLMs are incapable of incorporating social commonsense. Further, we find that LLMs' performance on Att questions is limited by their inability to determine the information that is accessible to a certain charac-
ter and using such information to reason about characters' emotions (Table 5). Hence, an efficient framework for documenting character-centric world state is needed. Further, as discussed in Zhan et al. (2023), people's attitude in reality is complicated and multifaceted. Therefore, to create a generalizable system capable of emotion deduction, instantiating the emotion deduction process similar to Wu et al. (2023a) is a potential solution.

Neural Theory-of-Mind N-ToM in general is a crucial cognitive capability that a helpful intelligent agent must possess. In the context of human psychology, a lack of ToM capabilities is oftentimes associated with developmental conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985). Therefore, as LLMs being developed and deployed as assistant agents, it is critical to understand their N-ToM capabilities and develop methods to grant them robust N-ToM reasoning capabilities. LLMs could especially benefit from \(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{ToM}\) in the following fields: (1) Educational LLM where a helpful assistant agent must be able to accurately model the mental state of the students to be able to provide efficient and precise guidance; (2) Negotiating LLM where understanding the mental states such as the intention, desire, and mood of the opponent is critical when planning negotiation strategies; (3) Mental Health LLM where assistant agent must comprehend the mental state and being empathetic with the patient to be able to provide meaningful help.

\section*{7 Conclusion}

We introduce OpenToM, a comprehensive N ToM benchmark featuring long narratives with realistic characters and events, and a diverse range of questions that cover both physical and psychological aspects of N-ToM. Our evaluation of LLMs' NToM capabilities on OpenToM reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on some NToM tasks, they are still far from human-level performance on tasks requiring emotion deduction.

\section*{Limitations}

Limitations of OpenToM are as follows:
Limited LLMs Due to the constraint of computing resources and budget, we only evaluated OpenTOM benchmark on a subset of available LLMs. While we believe that the selected LLMs are representative of the current state-of-the-art of their
categories (Llama2-Chat for open-source LLMs, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo for close-source LLMs, and Mixtral- \(8 \times 7 \mathrm{~B}\)-Instruct for Mixture-ofExpert LLMs), we acknowledge that there are other LLMs that could potentially perform better on OpenToM. Further, we only examine the zeroshot performance of LLMs, future studies should test models' N-ToM capabilities under a few-shot setting.

Potential Biases in OpenToM Narratives The drafts of OpenToM narratives are composed using LLMs. Although recent studies have shown that LLMs are capable of producing high-quality benchmarks (Efrat and Levy, 2020; Perez et al., 2022a,b; Hartvigsen et al., 2022; West et al., 2023), we acknowledge that the texts generated by LLMs could contain biases and lack lexical diversity.

Limited Scope in Character Emotion In OpenTOM benchmark, we construct questions regarding character's emotion (e.g. attitude). To reduce the subjectivity, we purposely design the stories in a way that the character's emotion can be directly deduced from an action that happens in a short time frame. In reality, human emotions are often complex, multifaceted, and may depend on multiple events through a prolonged period of time.

Limited Narrative Order All OpenToM narratives are linear narratives that strictly follow chronological order, which alleviate LLMs' burden to comprehending the order of the events. Future studies can consider constructing OpenToM narratives with non-linear order to further challenge LLMs' narrative understanding and N-ToM capabilities.

\section*{Ethics Statement}

The drafts of OpenToM narratives are generated using GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo. Although we did not identify any harmful or violent content in the OpenToM narratives, it is worth noting that previous studies have observed instances where LLMs produced unexpected results. Therefore, we encourage future studies to also be cautious when employing similar data generating strategies. Further, the OpenToM dataset is annotated by graduate students studying computer science. The similar background of annotators may introduce bias in the annotation process.
